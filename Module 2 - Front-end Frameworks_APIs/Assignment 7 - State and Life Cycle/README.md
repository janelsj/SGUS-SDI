# Class Component State and Life Cycle: Assignment

## Brief

You are to produce a simple light toggling page like this:

<img src=".light-app/src/components/assets/images/toggle-light.png" />

Where the orange box is an image display of either a turned on or off light bulb. Use these images and you can find them at `./assets/images` folder:

<img src=".light-app/src/components/assets/images/light-off.png" >
<img src=".light-app/src/components/assets/images/light-on.png" >

The blue box is button where you can toggle and change a boolean state. Based on the state, you will switch the image to light-on and light-off respectively.

Read [this](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-display-images-in-react-dfe22a66d5e7) to learn how to use image in react! Your knowledge from Module 1 would be transferrable here.

No code sample given. Do create a react app using `npx create-react-app <your app name>`.
