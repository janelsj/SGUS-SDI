# React Native Paper

Before starting this exercise, you may use this [link](https://snack.expo.dev/@react-native-paper/github.com-callstack-react-native-paper:example) to scan the QR Code with your phone to load a sample app with expo. 

Afterwhich, re-create the same UI you have attempted in the lesson.
