# RN Release Notes: Assignment

## Brief

In this assignment, you will learn about the best practice in writing a GIT COMMIT message. When a software development reached a certain version iterations, there are two sources that help determine release notes. The first source is the User Stories, Features and Bug Fixes you have done and documented in a project management platform such as [Trello](trello.com) or [Atlassian JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). The second source will be coming from your GIT COMMIT message. Therefore, it is important to write meaningful commit message so that the development team is able to track the details of work done.

Read and discuss how you may improve writing GIT COMMIT message as a group by referring to the below resources:

- Git Tips and Commit Best Practice [Link](https://gist.github.com/luismts/495d982e8c5b1a0ced4a57cf3d93cf60)
- Git commit best practices [Link](https://medium.com/@nawarpianist/git-commit-best-practices-dab8d722de99)

Once you're done, answer the following questions.

1. How have you been writing your commit message?

```
Updated xxx/ yyy
```

2. Name three improvements you are committed to after reading the reference links.

```
- Commit often with small pieces of code changes that are functional.
- Don't commit half-done codes that do not work.
- Each part of code change towards a targetted improvement/feature or bug fix should be committed separately with a descriptive commit message describing the change.
- Commit messages should be descriptive about the specific work that has been done (eg. bug fix 1, bug fix 2), and not an aggregated generic summary decribing a large chunk of code changes (eg. bug fixes).
```

3. After discussion with your group members, what other insights have you gained about GIT COMMIT best practices (if any).

```
- Commit messages should be in present tense.
- Commit messages should be:
1. Succinct
2. Descriptive, and
3. Representative
of all the changes we have made.
```
